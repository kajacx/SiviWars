ground levels:
integer from 0 to 5, inclusive
ground leves can differ by max 1 at adjectent fields, inclusing diagonally adjectent fields

sivi density levels:
float, from 0.0f to 10.0f, inclusive

top level:
10.0f, stacks for combined terrait and sivi height, so at terrain heigh 3 can sivi height be max 7.0f inclusive 

sivi density accurancy:
float values, accurancy from 0 to 1 (inclusive, exclusive) has 8 levels of accurancy:

0
0.125
0.25
0.375
0.5
0.625
0.75
0.875

by following rule:
sivi density always rounds down when rendered

moreover, for sivi distribution, sivi cannot flow somevere so there would be less than 0.125
so at least 0.25 sivi is needed to flow to new empty spot, even down by edge.
when flowing up and enge, at least 1.25f is required to distribute to empty field, so at least
0.125f appears at new position

also, if for any reason sivi is substracted or destroyed, at the end of one game step, if at any field reamins
less then 0.125 sivi, this sivi is destroyed (and transformed into mana, if available)
